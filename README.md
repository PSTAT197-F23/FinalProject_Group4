Vignette abstract: 
Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning method of identifying and grouping similar observations in a dataset without looking at the outcome. It is typically used to classify data into groups that allows for ease in understanding and manipulating. The data used in this vignette is California Housing Data from 1990 for each district in the state. The variables include the median income, median age of houses, average number of rooms, average number of bedrooms, population, average occupants, latitude, longitude, and median house value. The objective of the vignette is to learn about different clustering methods by utilizing them on California housing data. ADD OUTCOMES
