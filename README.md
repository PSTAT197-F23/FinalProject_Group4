# Final-Project

This is a template repository for a group assignment to produce a descriptive analysis of class survey data.

Your repository should contain:

1.  A brief .README summarizing repo content and listing the best references on your topic for a user to consult after reviewing your vignette if they wish to learn more
2.  A primary vignette document that explains methods and walks through implementation line-by-line (similar to an in-class or lab activity)
3.  At least one example dataset
4.  A script containing commented codes appearing in the vignette







A one-sentence description at the very top before any (sub)headers:

Vignette on implementing different clustering methods using California housing data; created as a class project for PSTAT197A in Fall 2023.

Contributors: Manuri Alwis, Jade Thai, Jennifer Rink, Kayla Katakis, and Kylie Maeda

Vignette abstract: a brief description in a few sentences of your vignette topic, example data, and outcomes. 
Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning method of identifying and grouping similar observations in a dataset without looking at the outcome. It is typically used to classify data into groups that allows for ease in understanding and manipulating. The data used in this vignette is California Housing Data from 1990 for each district in the state. The variables include the median income, median age of houses, average number of rooms, average number of bedrooms, population, average occupants, latitude, longitude, and median house value.
